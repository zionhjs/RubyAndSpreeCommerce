## Overview

**Spree 4.2** is a collaborative work of **34 amazing individuals** from around the globe who contributed **over 1500 commits** since Spree 4.1.

This release was intended to make Spree **accessible to anyone** in every place of our planet in **every country** and **every major language**. Besides new features, this release includes hundreds of bug fixes and improvements.

## Major/New Features

### Ruby 3.0 and Rails 6.1 support

Spree 4.2 can be run on Ruby 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and recently released 3.0. Spree 4.2 supports **both Rails 6.0 and 6.1** out of the box, so you don't need to upgrade to Rails 6.1 straight away, you can first move to Spree 4.2 and later perform the Rails upgrade minimizing the risk of any issues. Please see [Rails 6.1 announcement](https://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/12/9/Rails-6-1-0-release/) to check out the new amazing features that are packed in that release.

### New responsive Admin Panel UI

Thanks to the awesome work of [Matthew Kennedy](https://github.com/spree/spree/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22Admin+Panel+%E2%9A%99%EF%B8%8F%22+author%3AMatthewKennedy) supported by Spark team we were able
to deliver a brand new and modern Admin UI which works great on mobile and tablet devices.

This was done in a gradual enhancement process of the current codebase so all of the existing Extensions and customizations will still work as it's fully backward compatible.

The next releases will bring more Admin UI improvements such as a new Reporting dashboard.

### Built-in Multi-Currency and Multi-Language

We've pulled the best parts of [Spree Multi-Currency gem](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_multi_currency) of [Spree I18n](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n) into Spree itself and improved upon it combined with new multi Store support.

* each Store can have a default currency and a list of other supported currencies - this will affect products shown in each Store (only Products with prices in those currencies)

* each Store can have default locale (language) and a list of other supported locales

* each Product can have different prices in each currency for different Variants

* you can have multiple Stores with different default locales/currencies or a single Store with multiple locales / languages which you can switch between in the Storefront UI

* this is also supported by API v1 and v2 by passing simply `?locale=fr` and/or `?currency=EUR` in the URL

* Locale and Currency settings will be also respected in all Spree extensions
  
* Additional language packs are available via [Spree I18n gem](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n)

### Improved MultiStore support

Besides currency and language, we've greatly improved the Multi-Store support in Spree.

There are new additional settings and features for Store management available in the Admin UI:

* `Logo` - you can now upload logo, through Admin Panel for each Store :) ([Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10386))

* `Mailer Logo` - same as above but will be displayed in the email notifications ([Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10489))

* `Checkout Zone` - which [Zone record](https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/configuration/configuring_geography.html#zones) is used for Checkout, which in fact limits the Checkout for selected Countries or States ([Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues?q=label%3A%22Multi-Store+%F0%9F%8F%AC%22+is%3Aclosed+checkout))

* `Default Country` - which country should be pre-selected on Checkout Address ([Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10139))

* `Order Notification Email` for Store Owners ([Derek Johnson](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10253))

* `Checkout Payment Methods` - which Payment Methods should be available in each Store. Each payment method can be now assigned to multiple stores instead of one ([Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10457) and [Matthew Kennedy](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10684))

* `Store Contact info` that appears in the Storefront footer can be set now in the UI [Spark Solutions](https://github.com/spree/spree/pull/10128)

### New modern mobile first Email templates

Thanks to [El Passion team](https://www.elpassion.com/) we have now brand new and mobile-first email templates
for notifications such as Order Confirmation, Shipment notification and so on. All emails were rebuilt with [Postmark Email Templates](https://github.com/wildbit/postmark-templates) to meet current needs and standards.

To improve developer happiness our friends at [El Passion](https://www.elpassion.com/) prepared [email previews](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html#previewing-emails) for all email types to make it more convenient to work with emails in a development environment.

As part of these improvements, more of the email layouts can be managed via Admin UI, this includes:

* setting different logo for each Store
* setting locale (language) of Store will be reflected in emails which will be translated automatically, based on [Spree I18n](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_i18n)
* setting Store name will automatically change copy in emails
* all URLs in emails will point to the selected Store, this is also supported by Spree Auth Devise emails as well

### WCAG 2.1 AA compatible Storefront

We've invested a lot of time to make the default Storefront accessible for everyone. We've [enhanced Storefront](https://github.com/spree/spree/issues?q=label%3AAccessibility+is%3Aclosed) to be compatible with all [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) version 2.1.
