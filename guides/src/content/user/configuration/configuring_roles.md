## Introduction

Roles are used to define userâ€™s permissions on your website. This option gives you the ability to control the rights of users. By default, Spree offers two kinds of Roles: **Admin** and **User**. If you would like to make more roles with more specific features than the Admin and User roles, our company offers making those with the help of a little backend development work.
To open the **Roles** tab, extend the **Configuration** dropdown and find **Roles**.

## Creating a New Role

To create a new role, click the **New Role** button that is placed in the upper right corner of the page.
