## Introduction

Understanding your site's visitor traffic patterns are important for planning your company's marketing and growth strategies.

### Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce and Segment Ecommerce

In order to enable Spree Analytics Tracker, the following extension is required, which we have extracted from the Spree core: https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_analytics_trackers.

Spree's Admin Interface makes it easy for you to add the robust Google Analytics and Segment toolset to your site.

Both Google Analytics and Segment support detailed information of your site. Spree allows to integrate both in order to show live detailed events; for example, you can see on which step of the checkout process the user stopped or how long it took to complete the checkout.

Segment.com also allows you to plug-in a lot of additional vendors and services like:

* Mixpanel
* Kissmetrics
* Google Tag Manager
* Facebook Pixels
* Google Adwords remarketing
* [and hundreds others](https://segment.com/catalog/#integrations/all)

This integration gives you control without any additional help from the developer side.
You can then plan your strategies for marketing and track it without interrupting the work of your developers. Isn't that great?
