## Introduction

In order to assign Store Credits to the user's account you have to create **Store Credit Categories**. The category defines the reason the user received Store Credits to spend in your store.

To find **Store Credit Categories**, click on the **Configuration** dropdown and look for the **Store Credit Categories** option.

## Editing and Deleting Store Credit Categories

The previously created Category is visible in the Store Credit Categories settings. You can now create more of them or make additional changes to existing ones.
In every other section in Spree you can see **Edit** and **Delete** buttons next to the name of category.
