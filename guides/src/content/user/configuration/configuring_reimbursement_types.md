## Introduction

To make it easier for you when you make a reimbursement, there are reimbursement types that help you define what kind of return you give to the customer(e.g store credit, credit card or exchange for a new item).

## Creating a Reimbursement Type

You simply open the **Configuration** tab and press **Reimbursement Types**.
Now, you can see all previously set up types, with the possibility to add a new one.

You now only have to add a name and choose the type that you would like to have in your store.

The type is created via backend work and we're at your service to make it easy. This option defines what kind of return you give to the user, such as credit card refund or goods exchange for a new item.
